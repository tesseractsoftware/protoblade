
ProtoBlade is an open source turbomachinery design tool for creating CFD-compatible 3D CAD models. This tool is intended for use when
creating multiple prototypes (hence Proto) of turbomachinery blades (hence Blade). 3D CAD models can be created in a 'batch'
style situation which can integrated into automated unstructured meshing pipelines.
